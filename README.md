The rogue AI OMNIS has taken over the Vault, locking everything down tight. You must solve cryptic ciphers and puzzles to outsmart OMNIS and escape its control. But beware — each level ramps up the challenge, and too many mistakes might just drag you down forever...


## Gameplay 🎮
Choose your difficulty — Easy, Medium, or Hard — and dive into puzzles based on classic ciphers like Atbash, Binary, Caesar, Rail Fence, RSA, Vigenère and even Matrix transformations. Solve each puzzle to progress deeper, but get three attempts wrong and OMNIS will punish you with a falling animation… will you make it out alive?

### The game features:

A slick flip-card UI for level selection

Interactive puzzles with clues and hints

A helpful binary cipher reference image on select levels

Animated feedback and storytelling

A popup storyline to set the mood
